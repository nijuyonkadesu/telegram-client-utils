# Telegram-client-utils
A collection of simple scripts to automate tedious repetitive tasks using telethon. Please feel free to open Issues, Pull Requests or Feature Requests. I'll try my best to provide assistance!

## Getting Started

Run the following code snippet
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade telethon
pip install python-dotenv
```

Login and goto **API development tools** from the link: https://my.telegram.org/ and use the values to fill ```.env``` file.

To run the script: ```python filename.py```

## Motivation
An idea that randomly crossed the mind when I was looking for ways to truly explore telegram, to harness it's true power. And thanks to Harsh Navdhare for pointing me to telethon!.
